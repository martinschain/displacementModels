# displacementModels
Code for executing kinetic displacement models for PET data

The file applyDisplacementModels.m serves as a wrapper, 
and provides instructions on how to execute the displacement. 

The code has been tested on MATLAB 2014b, but it does not include 
any snippets that require later versions of MATLAB.

The manuscript describing these models are currently in preparation.
